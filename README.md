# Open Game Services (OGS)

## Goals

- **Easy to use for game devs** Designed from the ground up to be approachable by game developers to add backend functionality to their game
- **Modular** Add, remove, and modify modules from the backend to fit the use case for your game
- **Portable & lightweight** Built on boring technology that runs however you want to run OGS
- **Community-driven** Permissive licensing & modularity make it easy for devs to customize for their own use cases & contribute modules
- **Secure by default** Security & anti-botting should not be an afterthought for gaming backends
- **Documented** Strict typings & documentation are _required_ to make this easy to approach
