# Open Game Services (OGS)

## Development

Setup environment with:

```
deno task dev:setup
```

Start server with:

```
deno task start
```

## Goals

- **Package manager for game services** Adding backend functionality to your game should be as easy as one command
- **Easy to use for game devs** Designed from the ground up to be approachable by game developers to add backend functionality to their game
- **Modular** Add, remove, and modify modules from the backend to fit the use case for your game
- **Portable & lightweight** Built on boring, reliable technology that runs however you want to run OGS
- **Community-driven** Modularity make it easy for devs to customize for their own use cases & contribute modules
- **Secure by default** Security & anti-botting should not be an afterthought for gaming backends
- **Documented** Strict typings & documentation are _required_ to make this easy to approach
- **Permissively licensed** Apache 2.0 license allows developers to adapt & modify & redistribute
